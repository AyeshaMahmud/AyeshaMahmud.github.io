I am a demographer, and am broadly interested in the interplay between human demography and infectious disease dynamics. My research examines the social, demographic and environmental drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. I am an Assistant Professor of Demography at the University of California, Berkeley. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I was a Rockefeller Foundation Planetary Health Fellow at Harvard University. I received my Ph.D. in Demography from Princeton University in 2017.
